* Implement conditional CSS to dynamically style elements based on certain conditions such as availability of items, order status, or user preferences. For example, you can change the appearance of menu items that are sold out, highlight special offers, or adjust the layout based on screen size or device type.
CRUD Operations with MongoDB:

* Integrate MongoDB as the database backend to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing menu items, orders, customer information, and other data relevant to the Cloud Kitchen. Use MongoDB's flexible document-based data model to store and retrieve data efficiently, ensuring scalability and performance.
Display Data from API:

* Utilize APIs to fetch data such as real-time inventory levels, pricing information, or delivery status from external sources or internal systems. Display this data on the website to provide customers with up-to-date information and improve user experience. For example, show estimated delivery times based on live tracking data or display trending menu items based on popularity.
Edit in Modal and Save:

* Implement a modal popup interface for editing and updating information such as user profiles, order details, or delivery preferences. When users click on an edit button, display a modal window with form fields pre-populated with existing data. Allow users to make changes, validate input, and save updates without navigating away from the current page, providing a seamless editing experience.
Firebase Authentication:

* Integrate Firebase Authentication to securely authenticate users and manage user sessions across the Cloud Kitchen website. Allow users to sign up, sign in, and sign out using email/password, social media accounts, or phone number authentication. Implement user roles and permissions to control access to specific features or content, ensuring data privacy and security. Additionally, personalize user experiences based on authentication status, such as showing personalized recommendations or order history for authenticated users.
